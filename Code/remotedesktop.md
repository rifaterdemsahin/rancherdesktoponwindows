To trigger or enable Remote Desktop Services (RDS) on a Windows machine, you need to configure the settings depending on your version of Windows (Windows Server or Windows client). Below are the steps for enabling RDS on both environments.

### Method 1: Enable Remote Desktop on Windows Server (Enabling Remote Desktop Services Role)
If you are setting up Remote Desktop Services on a **Windows Server**, follow these steps:

1. **Open Server Manager**:
   - Click on **Start**, search for **Server Manager**, and open it.

2. **Add Roles and Features**:
   - In Server Manager, click **Manage** in the top-right corner and then select **Add Roles and Features**.

3. **Install Remote Desktop Services Role**:
   - In the wizard, select **Role-based or feature-based installation**.
   - Select your server from the server pool and click **Next**.
   - Scroll down the **Roles** list and check **Remote Desktop Services**.
   - Click **Next** and follow the prompts to install the role.

4. **Configure Remote Desktop Services**:
   - After the installation, configure Remote Desktop Licensing and install Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) role if required.

5. **Restart the Server**:
   - After the installation process is complete, you may need to restart the server.

### Method 2: Enable Remote Desktop on a Windows Client (Windows 10/11)
To enable **Remote Desktop** on a Windows client machine (e.g., Windows 10, 11), follow these steps:

1. **Open System Settings**:
   - Press `Win + I` to open **Settings**.
   - Go to **System** > **Remote Desktop**.

2. **Enable Remote Desktop**:
   - Toggle the switch to **Enable Remote Desktop**.
   - Click **Confirm** when prompted.

3. **Allow Remote Connections (Firewall)**:
   - Windows will automatically configure your firewall to allow Remote Desktop connections, but you can check it manually:
     - Press `Win + R`, type `control`, and press **Enter**.
     - Go to **System and Security** > **Windows Defender Firewall**.
     - Click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall**.
     - Ensure that **Remote Desktop** is allowed through both **Private** and **Public** networks.

4. **Configure User Access**:
   - By default, only users with administrator privileges can connect remotely. To allow other users:
     - Click on **Select users that can remotely access this PC** in the Remote Desktop settings window.
     - Add the users you want to grant access.

### Method 3: Using PowerShell to Enable Remote Desktop
You can use PowerShell to enable Remote Desktop as well:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

2. **Run the following command** to enable Remote Desktop:
   ```powershell
   Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -name "fDenyTSConnections" -Value 0
   ```

3. **Allow Remote Desktop through the Firewall**:
   ```powershell
   Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
   ```

4. **Verify the status** of Remote Desktop:
   ```powershell
   Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -name "fDenyTSConnections"
   ```

### Method 4: Using Group Policy (for Multiple Machines)
If you want to enable Remote Desktop for multiple machines across a domain, you can use Group Policy:

1. **Open Group Policy Editor**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press **Enter**.

2. **Navigate to the Following Path**:
   - Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Connections**.

3. **Enable Remote Desktop**:
   - Find and double-click on **Allow users to connect remotely using Remote Desktop Services** and set it to **Enabled**.

4. **Apply and Close**:
   - Click **Apply** and close the Group Policy Editor.

After performing these steps, Remote Desktop Services will be enabled, and you can connect to the machine using an RDP client.
