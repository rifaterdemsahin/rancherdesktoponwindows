It looks like you're encountering an error with code `0x8000ffff` when trying to install Ubuntu 24.04 via WSL. This error code typically represents a **"Catastrophic Failure"** in Windows, which can be caused by a number of issues such as corrupt system files, problems with the Microsoft Store, or a conflict with the WSL installation process.

Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

### Step 1: Check WSL Features
Ensure that all the necessary WSL components are enabled.

1. **Check if WSL and Virtual Machine Platform are enabled**:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following commands:
     ```bash
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
     ```
2. **Restart your system**.

### Step 2: Update WSL Kernel
Make sure your WSL kernel is up to date.

1. Download and install the [WSL kernel update package](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).
2. After installation, set WSL 2 as the default version:
   ```bash
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

### Step 3: Clear Previous Failed Installations
There might be remnants of previous failed installations that are causing this issue.

1. List all installed WSL distributions:
   ```bash
   wsl -l -v
   ```
2. Unregister any broken or problematic distributions:
   ```bash
   wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
   ```
3. After unregistering, try installing again:
   ```bash
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
   ```

### Step 4: Run Windows Update
Running Windows Update can resolve missing dependencies or other conflicts.

1. **Check for updates**:
   - Open **Settings** -> **Update & Security** -> **Windows Update** and click on **Check for updates**.
2. Install any pending updates and restart your system.

### Step 5: Install Ubuntu Manually
If the `wsl --install` command is still failing, you can manually install the distribution:

1. Download the Ubuntu `.appx` file from the [WSL manual install page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).
2. Run the following command in PowerShell to install the `.appx` package:
   ```bash
   Add-AppxPackage -Path <path to the downloaded appx>
   ```

After following these steps, try running the WSL installation again and see if the error is resolved.
